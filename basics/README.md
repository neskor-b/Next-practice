### Project Overview

| Problem                                        | Solution                                                         |
| -----------------------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Need a place to write some code                | Generate a new Next project bt running `npx create-next-app@latest`|
| Need to show different content on screen based on the path the user is visiting  |  Use Next's `file-based routing system`|
| Need to link between different pages           |  Use Next's build in `Link` component to navigate between different pages|
| The image we show are realy large              |  Use Next's build in `Image` component to optimize the image loading|                                      
| Seems we have a lot of duplicated code         |  Investigate strategies of code reuse |
